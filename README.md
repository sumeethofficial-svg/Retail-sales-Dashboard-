# Retail-sales-Dashboard-
This analysis focuses on understanding and quantifying sales performance, customer behavior, and product success within a retail context. The project answers a series of high-impact business questions to guide strategic decision-making.

Key Business Questions Addressed:

•	Sales Performance Tracking: Calculated the total sales for each product category (Q.4) and identified the best-selling month each year by analyzing average monthly sales (Q.8).

•	Customer & Product Deep Dive: Determined the average age of customers purchasing from specific categories, such as 'Beauty' (Q.5), and segmented transactions to identify the total count of unique customers by the item category they purchased (Q.9).

•	Transaction Analysis: Retrieved highly specific transactions, such as all sales on a particular date (Q.1) and transactions exceeding a high sales threshold (e.g., total sales greater than 1000) (Q.6).

•	Category-Specific Metrics: Calculated the total sales (Q.3) and total transactions by gender (Q.7) for specific product categories to understand demographic purchasing patterns.

•	Operational Insights: Created a function to categorize and count orders based on time-of-day shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) (Q.10), providing valuable data for staffing and operational planning.

Technology Used:

•	Database: PostgreSQL (demonstrates practical database querying skills).

•	Tool: pgAdmin

•	Skills: Advanced SQL querying, use of aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT), conditional logic (WHERE, HAVING), and grouping (GROUP BY).
